									<p>I finally got paid for my animation project. I skype called my mother to tell her that I got paid and she announced it to the family with pride. My father's sharp brain processed the
fact that I got my first salary five minutes earlier than the rest so he ran upto the phone and began reciting his retirement plans.</p>
								
									<p>"Now that you have a job I can finally retire and be what I've always wanted to be..." (I guess the fact that this wasn't a stable job and was just a one-time freelancing project slipped his mind) I was calm so I decided to humour him. <br>
"What have you always wanted to be?" I asked. <br>
"A farmer." <br>
Enough said. Everyone broke out into disagreements and hysterical laughter.<br></p>
									<p>My father's farming plan surfaced when I was in 12th grade and occassionally rears its ugly head when our family has the 'future talk'.
I guess the idea struck him when we went to my grandmother's house in Kerala for a vacation; she lives in an isolated part of town surrounded by greenery and she home grows her vegetables. We had paid her garden a visit one morning, to pick fresh vegetables to be prepared for lunch. At first I was grumbling being woken up and transferred from my cosy bed to a muddy, earthworm-infested terrain but soon I was fascinated by the vast organic growths of edible plant in my backyard. It was satisfying to hand-pluck a ripe, dewy vegetable from its stalk. The textures, smells and visuals of the garden refreshed all of us; little did we know it inspired my father to take it to the next level. </p>
									<p>"I want to be a farmer." <br>
He stated the same evening while staring at a ripe tomato cupped in his raised fist. Everyone at the dinner table except my grandparents began snickering. <br>
"I want to quit my job and become a farmer." <br>
"No." We said in unison. <br> My father stating that he wanted to quit his stable job to become a farmer was like the intelligent, prodigal student in class throwing away their (way too easily achieved for a human) admission to IIT to become an aspiring graffiti artist. <br> 
"Why? Don't you think I am capable of becoming a farmer?" <br> 
"No." We all stated in unison once again. I guess telling him that he didn't have what it takes to farm was a worse offense than telling him not to farm. But crushing his dreams was necessary (to ensure he doesn't chase after them). My mother convinced him not to pursue farming till both I and my sister have stable well paid jobs. <br>
</p>

<p>My father was capable of many things, he was really good in English or he could become an author and publish a novel or two. He was excellent in Maths and Physics, he could be a teacher but he chose farming, why? He is very patient but farming also requires luck and vast knowledge of fruits and vegetables, their seasons and growth cycles. I've seen him with vegetables, he genuinely enjoys the art of farming but I doubt he has the skills needed. </p>

<p>I guess the reason why my father wants to be a farmer was because he didn't have very many dreams as a kid cause they didn't have too many options. He enrolled and was placed in the army right after school.
He left the army honourably after 10 years of service and after I was born the burden of expectations was heavier on him so he immediately took up a job in Mumbai, after which he immediately took up a job in Dubai. There were no gaps for self-exploration. He only started dreaming when he realized me and my sister were growing fast and would soon be working which meant the burden of expectations were now ours to carry. </p>
<p> "Start with a single plant, perhaps chilly, or tomato, take care of it till it fruits and then think of a farm." Was the only advice I could think of. </p>
