									<p>My first freelancing project was with a sound designer called Manoj.
Manoj was actually my friend's uncle who was looking for someone to animate a music video
for a song he made (for a movie that was to be released in the future).
My friend asked my friends circle and I cause we were the only animators she knew. 
We said yes.</p>
								
									<p>This was the first time we were freelancing and this was the first time he was hiring students
to work for him.
The three of us agreed to deliver a (4 minute long) 2D animated music video. 
The problem was, he gave us only a month (less than a month actually) to work on it. 
Now if you've ever worked with 2D animation you know the rule; 1 month for 1 minute. 
Which means, to make an animated output that's one minute long (a good output, mind you) 
you need atleast a month. We tried to talk to Manoj about this but he encouraged us and
told us to just do our best and he will accept whatever output we give him. Despite his
assurance, we reluctantly agreed. </p>

									<p>He asked us how much we wanted to get paid. This is where the story branches out, 
so according to him, we never told him how much we wanted to get paid and we never mentioned any
 price, any expectation and we told him payment isnt important.  <br> But in reality, I told him we expect 10,000 rupees each, I told him we will only send
him the final product when he pays us and I told him that we expect payment (I never ever told
him that payment isnt important to us, oh hell no, a girl needs her mons to buy clothing).
</p>

<p>He told us us that 10,000 is a bit too expensive for him and that he will speak to us about 
payment later. Speak to us about payment later? Fine, we thought.<br>

No, not fine. <br>
This was the first mistake we made, not confirming the payment before starting the project. </p>

<p>Anyways, he gave us a script which explained what kind of scenes he wanted us to make for each
segment of the song and told us that we can be . We started working. We split the work; I'd do the character animations, 
Anupa would do the background animations and Aishu would animate the lyrics and work with the
sounds. 
</p>

<p>It took us a hectic three weeks to finish the first draft (We even skipped sleep for several
days to finish it off). We emailed a low quality video output of the first draft to him and
he said he loved it. We were happy and really encouraged. </p>

<p>Then all of a sudden he asks us to make a few changes, thinking that its just a few things
here and there we asked him to email us whatever he wanted us to change. 
He ended up sending us a huge excel sheet of really specific changes he wanted and there
were thousands of them! There was something he wanted us to change every 5 seconds of the
film, his initial script differed entirely from the current excel sheet he sent us. We told
him we would need more time because the changes he demanded were so vast it was as good as
starting over.</p>

<p>"Why cant you just make the changes and merge the two videos together?"
"Sir, its because you asked us for changes in between frames so we need to restart 
from scratch."
"Frames? What frames? You mean the scenes right? Yeah just make those changes and merge
the videos together!"
"That's.. not how its done sir.."
"Haha, I dont really know how this is done but the changes are very minor so dont take more
than a week."</p>

<p>
I tried to convince him to give us more time but he would hear of it. 
We had to restart from scratch but managed to do it within a week (We hadn't slept for
two days straight). We sent it to him and he said he liked it.
</p>

<p>
"I really like this but there are a few more changes I want you guys to implement,
don't worry! Its just a few minor changes here and there and you guys will be able to 
finish it within a day!"
</p>

<p>
He sends us another excel sheet full of changes to be made every 7 seconds; he wanted a 
different background in one scene, he wanted a different character in another scene, he
wanted different animations in one scene, he wanted us to add 'realistic smoke' in one scene
(realistic smoke in a 2D film that consisted of cartoons uptil this point) which made zero 
sense, and a lot more 'minor' changes literally everywhere.

What's worse? He gives us half a day to implement these 'changes'. We bargain and he agrees
to give us 48 hours to make the changes and send him the final output. At this point we've 
lost it so we just quickly make all the changes without a word and send it to him in 37 hours.
