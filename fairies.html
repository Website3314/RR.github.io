									<p>There are several fairies I have encountered in the 21 years of my existence.  <br> <br>

One such fairy is the self assumption fairy, 
whenever this fairy ecounters doubts or misunderstandings, it proceeds to assume various
scenarios that tend to be far from the truth. 
</p>
								
									<p>A good example of a self assumption fairy doing its thing is: <br> <br>
You arrive at office early, your friend (a hidden self assumption fairy) sees you and wishes you 
good morning but instead of 
returning the formality, you walk straight to your designated cubicle (a few cubicles ahead of your
friend's) and start working. Your friend begins to assume that perhaps he angered you
in some way, or perhaps you are in a bad mood, perhaps your throat was aching. What if you are 
fake and were only using this friend to get work done, now you no longer needed him so you 
don't need to pay any attention to him. This assumed scenario angers your friend, he acts out 
on it and goes around telling everyone that you are fake. He starts ignoring you, he doesn't 
sit next to you during the coffee break and he even tweets about it. #FakeFriends.
 </p>

									<p>Asking you what's wrong and confronting isn't an option for the self assumption fairy, 
cause what's the fun in doing something sensible and less time consuming, eh? <br> <br>

Naturally, someone comes and tells you of the drama your friend is creating so when you 
confront him about this and he passive aggressively asks you why you're talking to him again 
after ignorning his greeting yesterday, you're perplexed.  <br> <br>

"I had my earphones in my ears, I was listening to music, I hadn't even heard you!"
You tell him. His eyes widen, he laughs, nervously realizing how much he needlessly bitched 
about you and apologizes sheepishly. You groan and return to your seat. <br> <br>

Such is the self assumption fairy. <br> <br> <br>
</p>
									<p>Another fairy I have encountered is the know-it-all relative fairy. <br> <br>

This fairy is usually some relative of yours who boasts about how experienced he is in life
and how much he struggled in his childhood and how well his kids are doing abroad or at school or in college. This fairy
often thinks he knows what's best for you. He'll try to make a joke out of everything you say
(especially if you're much younger to him) and laugh really loudly. 
He'll compare your worth to that of his kids (and try to get your parents to compare your 
worth to that of his kids (to make his kids seem better, but if he knows you're better he
probably won't even mention his kids)). <br> <br>

A classic example goes as follows (note, this example happens very often in Indian households):<br> <br>

You serve tea and snacks to this fairy when he arrives at your house. He'll ask you if you made
the tea (even if you're 3). If you say no, he'll brag about how his kids (are forced to) 
make him tea thrice a day (to satisfy his beverage addiction), if you say yes he'll judge 
your tea and tell you how you can make it better (to his tastes). <br>

Then when you sit down (for the obligatory awkward one-on-one that goes on when a relative 
visits) he'll bombard you with the same questions he asked you the last time 
he visited; how old are you now, which grade are you in, how are your studies, what do you do 
in a day, what are you good at, etc. 
</p>

<p>Then he asks you the most important of all questions, which he purposely saves for last,
"How are your studies?"
Awkward silence.
"They're going well." you answer.
"Haha, how can you tell if they're going well, your parents should tell if its going well or
not! HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAHAHAHAHA!!!!!" He laughs as if he's cracked the joke of the century
and everyone fake laugh along with him. 
"I answered cause you asked me." You think in your mind, cause if you actually say this in real
life it would render his joke null and that's an insult. Don't ask me why, in an Indian 
household it just is. Relatives are like God! It doesnt matter that he tried to make you look
like a fool. It doesn't matter if his jokes are stale. Don't worry, when you reach his age, 
you can avenge yourself and take it out on your relatives' innocent children. For now just
shut up and act amused. 
</p>

<p>
Your parents tell him how you're doing at your studies (by telling him the grades and marks
you got in your exams). 
If you're doing better than his kids, he'll just respond with a 'good'.
But if you got even a percent less in one subject, he'll start bragging and giving you advice
that you've already heard a hundred times.

Then he'll smile and nod, silence ensues. 
He'll now look at you up to down and try to pinpoint your most obvious shortcomings infront of 
everyone (if you dont have any (aka you look better than his kids), he'll turn to your dad and 
start talking to him). <br> <br>

"Why is she so short?" <br>
"Why is her hair so thin?"<br>
"Why does she have glasses?"<br>
"Why does she have so many pimples?" <br>
"Why is the nail on the fourth toe of her right foot not pedicured?" <br> <br>
                                          
Your parents will answer for you, and he'll recommend doctors, or medicines.</p>

<p>Your parents will answer for you, and he'll recommend doctors, or herbal medicines.
He'll tell you to eat kiwis for your thin hair, don't bother telling him that you're allergic
cause he thinks allergies are just myths and if you dont pay attention to it, it wont
affect you (That's how deluded he is and he'll argue to huge extents to prove he's right).
</p>

<p> Such is the know-it-all relative fairy, he makes bullies look like besties.</p>

<p> <br> More undiscovered fairies to be revealed soon...</p>
