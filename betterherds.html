									<p>So I registered for a Graphic Design course in my college hoping to 
gain some knowledge and come out with a decent project to add to my portolio
and I joined this course specifically cause it had a list of prereqs; 
intermediate knowledge Painting, Spacial design, Digital Marketing, Communicative Illustration,
Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and CoralDraw.</p>
								
									<p>I considered myself a novice in all these fields and since our courses are usually 
chilled out and dont usually require prereqs I took this course to see why
exactly it required so many. Moreover, there were no other courses that I was interested in taking up. </p>
									<p>Innocent curiosity.
Big mistake. </p>
									<p>To begin with, the course started with the teacher announcing that we wouldnt be 
learning anything and that the final output of the course was to design 5 logos for five different
companies and a new blueprint plan to construct a brand new station for the metro.
Another necessity was that the work had to be
made in a group (no individual work would be accepted).
</p>

<p>The entire class was randomly shuffled into two groups, 
I was put into a group with students who were experts in all the subjects on the prerequisite
lsit and they knew various softwares that I hadnt even heard of; Cinema 4D, 3dsmax,
Fusion 9, Fusion 360, Houdini, you name it (to add insult to injury,
several of these students were my juniors). I was happy to be placed into the 
'smart group', the group that knew everything and was already writing down plans. 
My happiness was short lived. </p>

<p>From Day 1, it felt like I was an illiterate surrounded by scholars. </p>

<p> While I was busy mind mapping and thinking of ideas to make our logos creative and our
blueprints well organised, they had already gone to the stationary and purchased the papers
for drawinbg out the rough blueprints they had in mind and had already come up with 20 different designs for the logos. A team member comes up to me and asks me what I could do, 
<br> <br>
"I can make designs and I'm good at drawing so.." <br>
"Excellent, here's some papers, draw the final design for our first logo using these 
5 rough designs that we made, try to combine and incoorporate as much of these rough designs as you can, we want three a4 sized printouts and a soft copy in two hours, thanks!"
<br>
"Wait! I'm not that goo-!"
"Thanks!!!!" 
<br> <br>
And off she ran to discuss ideas for the second logo with the teacher.
I didn't know what to do, but I didn't want to disappoint them so I started off immediately and tried to come up with something worthy. They wanted me to combine all five rough ideas of theirs together into one single logo but each design was so different. I did my best and in one hour, created an awkward amalgamation of all the ideas. Before I could show it to one of my team's more experienced members, the teacher walks up behind me and asks,
<br> <br>
"What's this?"<br>
"Oh sir, its just the final design for our first logo."<br>
"It looks really bad, I wont accept this design, please redo it!" He says and walks away before I could defend myself. 

I ran upto the same team member who assigned me the task and told her about this. <br><br>
"Well, why did you show it to the teacher without showing it to us first?"<br>
"He was right behind me, I didnt even notice him behind me!"<br>
"He rejected this, which means he wont accept any of the rough designs either, we're going to have to redo it from scratch."<br>
"No no he never said that he didnt like the rough designs, he just didnt like my final design, I'll remake it well." <br>
"No no, I know this teacher well, he wont accept any of it, trust me, you're going to have to come up with your own final design in one hour, make sure its something innovative and use only sober colours, good luck!"<br>
<br>
I groaned silently and did my best to come up with some sort of innovative, creative logo design in one hour, I managed to make something worthy and printed 3 copies of it plus a softcopy. The other members were scattered around class discussing the blueprints so I decided to go to the canteen for a short, 10 minute break. When I returned to class, I noticed all my team members were speaking to the teacher, their heads turned to me as I opened the door. <br> <br>

"Rhea! Where were you?" One of them asked.
"I was just taking a break in the canteen."
"Come here with your final logo design!"<br> <br>

I picked up the papers from my table and ran upto them. That's when I realised they had already finished the final designs for the remaining four logos and had already shown it to the teacher. They were waiting for me. I walk upto the teacher's table, he's wearing his 
glasses and has a paper to his face; looking at one of the logos. Through the reflection of his glasses I could see that the logo being studied used a completely different set of colours but looked a lot better than mine, my self-esteem dropped. He noticed my silhouette approaching. <br><br>

"Ah Rhea!" He smiled, extending his hand to accept my papers. 
The minute his eyes met the paper, his smiled disappeared. Shit. <br>
"Urm... this is far better than the previous design you made, I really like the strokes and curves, simplistic and effective.. but..."<br>
Ah, the dreaded but.. It usually meant a lot of changes or a complete redo of the assignment.
<br>
"...This colour combination doesnt work well with the other logos you guys have showed me so far. Didn't you guys sit and decide the designs together?"<br>
I could feel my team members' eyes boring holes through me. 
No, I thought to myself. These guys were all over class, talking and discussing, some had gone out to buy material for the blueprints. I didn't even know there were others working on the logo, I didnt see anyone working on the logo. When and how did these guys even  manage to finish designing four more logos in this short amount of time?
<br>
"Anyways,  the other logos are fine but change this one to make it work with the others." <br>
"Yes sir, thankyou sir." Someone from our group said. I walked back to my table silently, embarrassed. 
<br><br>
"Erm, Rhea, didn't I tell you to use sober colours?" <br>
"Yeah that's why I used black and white."<br>
The expression she made next seemed like she was forcing back a face palm. I understood.<br>
"I'm sorry, I should've asked you first, its my fault, I take full responsi-"<br>
"Do you know how to make a blueprint?" She asked, ignoring my words. <br>
"No. I've never made a blueprint before."<br> She made the same expression again. <br>
"Why did you take this course?"<br>
Her question caught me off guard. Kind of a rude question to ask, but there was no point arguing over it, she was right to ask me this question. I sighed.<br>
"Because I was curious, and because there was no other course I was interested in so I didnt exactly have much choice."<br>
<br>
She giggled. <br>
"I understand, its just, this course needs people who are good in graphic design. One would expect only experts to take up this course."<br>
"I do have basic knowledge of graphic design, I didn't know I needed to be that good for this course."<br> I said, swallowing my hurt pride. <br> I wish I never took up this course, I wish I could take up something else but it was too late. I guess the team member could see the discomfort on my face. <br>
"Hey, its ok, I was just like you a year back. I was clueless and nearly got kicked out of my team because I didnt know anything. Back then, I hated teamwork cause I was always the liability, the weak member of the team." she said, softening her voice. <br>
As insulted as I was by her words, I stayed silent, ackowledging that it was fact. <br>
"This course will be difficult for you but try to contribute as much as you can. Atleast you'll know where you're lacking, and what you need to learn." She pat my shoulder, and ran to her desk.<br><br>
She was right, its about time I learnt my place anyways. The course got increasingly harder but I tried to absorb as much knowledge as I could from the other team members. I learnt a lot and swore to make myself an expert on the softwares that I was lacking on. </p>
